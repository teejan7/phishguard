# 🛡️ PhishGuard: AI-Powered Phishing Detection System

**PhishGuard** is a sophisticated web application designed to detect and classify phishing websites in real-time. It utilizes a **Hybrid Detection Engine** that combines machine learning (Gradient Boosting) with heuristic keyword analysis to identify malicious URLs with high accuracy.



## 🚀 Key Features

* **Hybrid Detection Engine:**
    * **AI Model:** Uses a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** to analyze structural URL features (length, special characters, IP usage).
    * **Heuristic Scanner:** Applies a penalty system for URLs containing high-risk social engineering keywords (e.g., "banking", "secure", "login").
* **Real-Time Analysis:** Instantly extracts and processes 8 key features from any input URL.
* **Visual Risk Scoring:** Provides a clear percentage-based safety score, categorizing sites as **Safe**, **Suspicious**, or **Phishing**.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with **Streamlit**, offering a clean, professional dark-themed UI with detailed technical telemetry and risk breakdown.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python web framework)
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Model Serialization:** Joblib
* **Language:** Python 3.x

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `app.py` | The main application file containing the Streamlit UI and hybrid detection logic. |
| `analysis.ipynb` | **Training Lab:** Jupyter Notebook used to clean data, train the Gradient Boosting model, and save it as `.pkl`. |
| `phishing_model.pkl` | The trained AI model file (generated by the notebook) used for predictions. |
| `dataset_phishing.csv` | The dataset containing 11,430 legitimate and phishing URLs used for training. |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python libraries required to run the project. |

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/teejan7/phishguard.git](https://github.com/teejan7/phishguard.git)
    cd phishguard
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Application**
    Launch the web interface:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    *(Note: The model `phishing_model.pkl` is already included. If you want to retrain it, open `analysis.ipynb` and run all cells.)*

## 📊 How It Works

1.  **Training (analysis.ipynb):** The model was trained on the `dataset_phishing.csv` dataset. It learned to distinguish between safe and phishing URLs based on 8 key structural features.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** The app parses user input to extract features like URL length, dot count, and IP address usage.
3.  **AI Prediction:** The saved model calculates a probability score based on these features.
4.  **Heuristic Adjustment:** The system adds a penalty if the URL contains suspicious words like "verify" or "wallet".
5.  **Final Verdict:** The site is classified as Safe 🟢, Suspicious 🟠, or Phishing 🔴 based on the final risk score.
